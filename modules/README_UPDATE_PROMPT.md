Write or update the README.md file in every module folder according to real implementation that would help developers to use given module. It must contain the following sections Overview, Domain Model, Features, Configuration Settings, Logging Configuration, API endpoints, Database Schemas, Dependencies

Important:
1. Do not put code examples, because they will be outdated quickly
2. Show API examples using curl only
3. Show dependencies on other modules only, no need to put other dependencies
4. Domain model can contain hierarchical objects structure or/and a diagram with the objects relationship, as text
